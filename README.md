**Important:** Replace ```:author_name``` ```:author_username``` ```:author_email``` ```:author_website``` ```:vendor``` ```:package_name``` ```:package_description``` with their correct values in [README.md](README.md), [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md), [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md), [LICENSE](LICENSE), [composer.json](composer.json) and [phpunit.xml.dist](phpunit.xml.dist) files either manually or by running `$ php prefill.php` in the command line. Delete this paragraph and prefill.php afterwards.

This is where your library description should be.
